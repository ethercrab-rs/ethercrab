# Slave discovery

- Devices are discovered using an Ethernet broadcast (allballs destination MAC)
- SOEM has `ecx_detect_slaves` which sends a BRD and reads the working counter to detect number of
  slaves.
- Once the slaves have been counted by index, they can be assigned a "configured station address" by
  the master

TODO: Send a `BRD` with various devices and check WKC.

# Confirming frames

Master sets `idx` to a locally unique value and waits for a returned PDU with that same index or
until a timeout occurrs.
