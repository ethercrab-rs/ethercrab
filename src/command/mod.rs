/// PDU command.
///
/// A command can be used in various different ways, to e.g. read a number or write a raw slice to a
/// slave device on the network.
///
/// All EtherCAT commands are implemented. It is recommended to use the methods on `Command` to
/// create them.
///
/// A `Command` won't do much on its own. To perform network operations with the command it must be
/// wrapped with either [`WrappedRead`] or [`WrappedWrite`] by calling the `wrap` method. These
/// structs add a [`Client`](crate::Client) and expose many different read/write operations. See the
/// methods on [`WrappedRead`] and [`WrappedWrite`] for more.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Read a `u32` from a slave by address
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ethercrab::{ std::tx_rx_task, Client, ClientConfig, PduStorage, Timeouts };
/// use ethercrab::{ Command, RegisterAddress };
/// # static PDU_STORAGE: PduStorage<16, 1100> = PduStorage::new();
/// # let (_tx, _rx, pdu_loop) = PDU_STORAGE.try_split().expect("can only split once");
/// let client = /* ... */
/// # Client::new(pdu_loop, Timeouts::default(), ClientConfig::default());
///
/// let slave_configured_address = 0x1001u16;
///
/// # async {
/// let value = Command::fprd(slave_configured_address, RegisterAddress::SiiData.into())
///     .wrap(&client)
///     .receive::<u32>()
///     .await?;
/// # Result::<(), ethercrab::error::Error>::Ok(())
/// # };
/// ```
///
/// ## Write a slice to a given slave address and register
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ethercrab::{ std::tx_rx_task, Client, ClientConfig, PduStorage, Timeouts };
/// use ethercrab::{ Command, RegisterAddress };
/// # static PDU_STORAGE: PduStorage<16, 1100> = PduStorage::new();
/// # let (_tx, _rx, pdu_loop) = PDU_STORAGE.try_split().expect("can only split once");
/// let client = /* ... */
/// # Client::new(pdu_loop, Timeouts::default(), ClientConfig::default());
///
/// let slave_configured_address = 0x1001u16;
/// let register = 0x1234u16;
///
/// let data = [ 0xaau8, 0xbb, 0xcc, 0xdd ];
